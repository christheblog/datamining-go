## Description

Giving a go at go ... This is my first project in golang, to try out the capabilities of the language (especially abstraction/design capabilities and usage of go routines).

On a long run, this project will contain some implementations of basic data mining algorithm like knn, kmeans, etc.
I will try to provide some standard as well as some parallel implementations of the algorithms, as this is what I am ultimately interested in.

## Knn

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm

Implemented : Standard Knn and a divide-and-conquer parallel Knn using go routines.

## KMeans

Implemented : Standard Kmeans and a divide-and-conquer parallel Kmeans using go routines.
